                                            quarantine made me feel sad. I dont have someone to talk to in the house since my family is in our province and I am not allowed to go outside 
                                            to see my friends either but I had no choice since I need to stay here in Quezon City. All I do for months is to sit in front of my laptop and study. 
                                            My anxiety was getting worse when suddenly, I saw the adoption post of Quezon City Animal Care and Adoption Center.  A cute dog caught my 
                                            attention. Her beautiful eyes suddenly made me feel at ease. It is like she talking to me through her eyes and that when an idea came to my mind. 
                                            I want to adopt this cute little dog!.</Typography>
